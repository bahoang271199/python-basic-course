    "# Lesson 4.3: While Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will learn about the **`while`** loop in Python. A `while` loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition remains true. This is a powerful tool when you don't know the exact number of iterations beforehand.\n",

    "## 1. The Structure of a `while` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "A `while` loop continues to execute the code block within it as long as the test condition is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # This block of code will be executed repeatedly\n",
    "    # as long as the condition remains True\n",
    "    # Ensure there is a mechanism to change the condition\n",
    "    # so the loop can eventually terminate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `condition`: A Boolean expression. The loop will continue to run as long as this expression evaluates to `True`.\n",

    "## 2. Infinite Loops and How to Escape Them\n",
