    "\n",
    "In programming, repeating a block of code multiple times is a very common task. The `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence (like a List, Tuple, String) or other iterable objects. This lesson will help you master how to use `for` loops effectively.\n",

    "## 1. The `for` loop with `range()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `range()` function is a built-in Python function that generates a sequence of numbers. It is often used with `for` loops to iterate a specific number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax of `range()`:**\n",
    "* `range(stop)`: Generates a sequence of numbers from `0` up to `stop-1`.\n",
    "* `range(start, stop)`: Generates a sequence of numbers from `start` up to `stop-1`.\n",
    "* `range(start, stop, step)`: Generates a sequence of numbers from `start` up to `stop-1`, with a step size of `step`.\n",
