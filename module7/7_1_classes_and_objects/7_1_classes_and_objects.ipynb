    "# Lesson 7.1: Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python programming, especially as you start building more complex applications, understanding and utilizing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is crucial. This lesson will introduce two core concepts of OOP: **Classes** and **Objects**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Concept of Class and Object\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a **Class** as a blueprint, a template, or a definition for a certain type of object. It is not the object itself, but rather a description of how objects of that type will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Class defines:\n",
    "* **Attributes:** The data or characteristics that objects of that Class will have (e.g., name, age, color).\n",
    "* **Methods:** The behaviors or functions that objects of that Class can perform (e.g., run, speak, calculate).\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Object\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Object** (also known as an instance) is a concrete entity created from a Class. If a Class is the blueprint, then an Object is the actual house built based on that blueprint. Each Object will have the attributes and methods defined in the Class, but with its own distinct values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "* **Class:** `Dog` (Blueprint for a dog)\n",
    "* **Objects:** `my_dog` (my dog), `neighbor_dog` (neighbor's dog)\n",
    "    * `my_dog` might have attributes `name = \"Buddy\"`, `breed = \"Labrador\"`.\n",
    "    * `neighbor_dog` might have attributes `name = \"Max\"`, `breed = \"German Shepherd\"`.\n",
    "    * Both can perform the method `bark()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Defining Classes in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "You define a Class using the `class` keyword, followed by the Class name and a colon `:`. By convention, Class names typically start with an uppercase letter (PascalCase).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    # Class attributes and methods\n",
    "    pass # 'pass' is a placeholder statement that does nothing\n",
    "```\n",

    "## 3. Attributes and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attributes** are variables that store data related to an object. There are two main types:\n",
    "* **Class Attributes:** Shared by all objects of the Class.\n",
    "* **Instance Attributes:** Unique to each object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will focus on Instance Attributes, which are defined in the `__init__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Methods\n",

    "## 4. The Constructor Method (`__init__`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The special method `__init__` (pronounced \"dunder init\" - double underscore init) is a **constructor method**. It is automatically called every time you create a new object from the Class. The primary purpose of `__init__` is to initialize the object's initial state by assigning values to its attributes.\n",

    "\n",
    "* `self` represents the **instance** of the Class on which the method is being called.\n",
