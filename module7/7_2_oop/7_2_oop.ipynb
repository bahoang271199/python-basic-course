    "# Lesson 7.2: Basic OOP Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will delve into three core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**. Mastering these principles will help you design and build more robust, flexible, and maintainable software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation** is the principle of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (a class), and restricting direct access to some of the object's components. The goal is to protect data integrity and control how data is modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the concept of encapsulation is implemented using naming conventions and special attributes/methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Public, Protected (`_`), Private (`__`) Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does not have true \"private\" mechanisms like some other languages (e.g., Java, C++). Instead, it uses naming conventions to suggest access levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Public Attributes:**\n",
    "    * No special prefix.\n",
    "    * Can be accessed from anywhere, both inside and outside the Class.\n",
    "    * **Example:** `self.name`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Protected Attributes:**\n",
    "    * Starts with a single underscore (`_`).\n",
    "    * By convention, these attributes are considered \"internal\" to the Class and its subclasses. While still accessible from outside, the convention is that you should not do so directly.\n",
    "    * **Example:** `self._balance`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Private Attributes (Name Mangling):**\n",
    "    * Starts with two underscores (`__`).\n",
    "    * Python performs a mechanism called \"name mangling\" to make direct access from outside the Class more difficult. The attribute name will be transformed into `_ClassName__attributeName`.\n",
    "    * Although still accessible by using the mangled name, the intent is to prevent direct external access.\n",
    "    * **Example:** `self.__password`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**"

    "## 2. Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance** is a principle that allows a new Class (Child Class or Subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing Class (Parent Class or Superclass). This promotes code reuse and creates an \"is-a relationship\" between Classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "* **Code Reusability:** Avoids writing the same code multiple times.\n",
    "* **Feature Extension:** Child Classes can add new attributes and methods.\n",
    "* **Code Organization:** Creates a clear hierarchical structure for Classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Parent Class and Child Class\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parent Class (Superclass):** The Class from which attributes and methods are inherited.\n",
    "* **Child Class (Subclass):** The Class that inherits from the Parent Class. It can access the Parent Class's attributes and methods, and can also define its own additional attributes/methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "When a Child Class defines a method with the same name as a method in its Parent Class, the method in the Child Class will \"override\" the Parent Class's method. This allows the Child Class to provide a specific implementation for a behavior already defined in the Parent Class.\n",

    "The `super()` function is used to call a method from the Parent Class. It is commonly used in the `__init__` method of a Child Class to ensure that the Parent Class's attributes are also properly initialized.\n",

    "## 3. Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism** means \"many forms.\" In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different Classes to be treated through a common interface. This means you can write code that works with objects of various types as long as they share a common behavior (e.g., the same method name).\n",

    "### a. Concept of Polymorphism\n",
