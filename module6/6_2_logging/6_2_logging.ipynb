    "# Lesson 6.2: Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "In the process of developing and operating software applications, tracking what's happening inside your program is incredibly important. **Logging** is a powerful technique that allows you to record events, error messages, warnings, and other useful information as your program runs. This lesson will introduce you to Python's `logging` module and how to use it effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Why Use Logging Instead of `print()`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many new programmers often use the `print()` function to check variable values or trace program flow. However, `print()` has several limitations when you need a serious logging solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lack of Context:** `print()` only outputs to the screen (or console) without providing information about the timestamp, the severity level of the message, or which module generated the message.\n",
    "* **Difficult to Manage:** In a large application, having hundreds of `print()` statements scattered everywhere makes it very hard to turn them on/off, filter, or redirect output.\n",
    "* **Inflexible:** You cannot easily configure `print()` to write to a file, send over a network, or display only critical messages.\n",
    "* **Performance:** `print()` can impact performance, especially when called frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's `logging` module addresses all these issues by providing a flexible and powerful framework for logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Basic `logging` Module Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The `logging` module is built into Python; you don't need to install it separately. To get started, you just need to import it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Configuration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can configure `logging` to start recording messages. The simplest way is to use `basicConfig()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic configuration:\n",
    "# - level: Sets the minimum logging level to be recorded (e.g., INFO)\n",
    "# - format: The format of the log message\n",
    "# - filename: Writes logs to a file instead of the console (optional)\n",
    "# - filemode: 'w' (overwrite file), 'a' (append to file)\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,\n",
    "                    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Log messages\n",
    "logging.debug(\"This is a DEBUG message.\")\n",
    "logging.info(\"This is an INFO message.\")\n",
    "logging.warning(\"This is a WARNING message.\")\n",
    "logging.error(\"This is an ERROR message.\")\n",
    "logging.critical(\"This is a CRITICAL message.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the code above, if `level` is set to `INFO`, you will see `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL` messages printed to the console (or written to a file if `filename` is specified). The `DEBUG` message will not appear because its level is lower than `INFO`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Logging Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "The `logging` module defines different severity levels for log messages. This allows you to filter and control which messages are recorded based on their importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Severity order (from lowest to highest):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`logging.DEBUG` (10):** Detailed information, typically only of interest when diagnosing problems.\n",
    "* **`logging.INFO` (20):** Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n",
    "* **`logging.WARNING` (30):** An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g., 'disk space low'). The software is still working as expected.\n",
    "* **`logging.ERROR` (40):** Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.\n",
    "* **`logging.CRITICAL` (50):** A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set the minimum level for your logger using the `level` parameter in `basicConfig()` or by setting the `level` attribute of the logger object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**"

    "## 4. Logging to Console and File\n",
    "\n",
    "The `logging` module allows you to configure where log messages should be sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Logging to Console (Default)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you don't specify `filename` in `basicConfig()`, log messages are printed to the console (stdout or stderr).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "# Configure to print to console\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",

    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",

    "logging.info(\"Program finished.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "`exc_info=True` parameter is very useful when logging errors, as it will include the full traceback information of the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Logging to File\n",
    "\n",
    "To log to a file, you simply provide the `filename` parameter to `basicConfig()`.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "log_file_path = \"app_log.log\"\n",

    "    os.remove(log_file_path)\n",

    "                    filename=log_file_path,\n",
    "                    filemode='w') # 'w' for overwrite, 'a' for append\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get a logger instance (typically used for each module)\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) # __name__ is the name of the current module\n",
    "\n",
    "logger.info(\"Application started.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        logger.debug(f\"Performing division: {a} / {b}\")\n",

    "```\n",
    "After running this code, you will find an `app_log.log` file in the same directory containing all the log messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** To log to both the console AND a file simultaneously, you need a more advanced logger configuration using `Handler`s (to be covered in more advanced lessons if needed). With `basicConfig()`, you can only choose a single destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practice Exercises:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Basic Configuration and Log Levels:**\n",
    "    * Configure `logging` to only display messages of `INFO` level and above.\n",
    "    * Log a `DEBUG` message, an `INFO` message, and a `WARNING` message. Observe the output.\n",
    "2.  **Logging to File:**\n",
    "    * Configure `logging` to write all messages (`DEBUG` level and above) to a file named `my_program.log`.\n",
    "    * Ensure the log format includes the timestamp, level, and message.\n",
    "    * Log a few `INFO` and `ERROR` messages.\n",
    "    * After running, open `my_program.log` to check its content.\n",
    "3.  **Logging Errors with `exc_info`:**\n",
    "    * Write a function that attempts to convert a non-numeric string to an integer (e.g., `int(\"hello\")`).\n",
    "    * Use `try-except` to catch the `ValueError`.\n",
    "    * In the `except` block, use `logging.error()` with `exc_info=True` to log the error along with its full traceback to the log file."
