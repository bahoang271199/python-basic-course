    "# Lesson 6.3: Basic Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "In software development, finding and fixing errors (known as **debugging**) is an essential skill. This lesson will introduce you to common types of errors in Python and basic debugging techniques, from printing variable values to using professional debuggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Common Python Programming Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Before learning how to debug, it's important to recognize the common types of errors you might encounter. Python will report these errors by displaying a `Traceback`, which provides information about where the error occurred and what type of error it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`SyntaxError`:**\n",
    "    * Occurs when you write code that does not conform to Python's syntax rules. The program will not be able to run.\n",
    "    * **Example:** Missing a colon, parenthesis, or keyword misspelling.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # if 5 > 2\n",
    "    #     print(\"Hello\") # Error: Missing colon after if condition\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`NameError`:**\n",
    "    * Occurs when you try to use a variable, function, or module that has not been defined (or is misspelled).\n",
    "    * **Example:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # print(my_variable) # Error: my_variable is not defined\n",
    "    # my_func()          # Error: my_func is not defined\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`TypeError`:**\n",
    "    * Occurs when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate data type.\n",
    "    * **Example:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # result = \"hello\" + 5 # Error: Cannot concatenate string with integer\n",
    "    # len(123)             # Error: len() not applicable to integer\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`IndexError`:**\n",
    "    * Occurs when you try to access an index that is out of range for a sequence (list, tuple, string).\n",
    "    * **Example:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    # print(my_list[3]) # Error: Index 3 is out of range (0, 1, 2)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`KeyError`:**\n",
    "    * Occurs when you try to access a key that does not exist in a dictionary.\n",
    "    * **Example:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\"}\n",
    "    # print(my_dict[\"age\"]) # Error: Key 'age' does not exist\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`ValueError`:**\n",
    "    * Occurs when a function receives an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value.\n",
    "    * **Example:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # num = int(\"abc\") # Error: String \"abc\" cannot be converted to an integer\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`AttributeError`:**\n",
    "    * Occurs when you try to access a non-existent attribute or method on an object.\n",
    "    * **Example:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # my_string = \"hello\"\n",
    "    # my_string.append(\"world\") # Error: String does not have an append method\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Debugging Technique by Printing Variable Values\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the simplest and most common debugging technique, especially useful for small programs or when you want to quickly check the value of a variable at a specific point.\n",
    "\n",
    "You just need to insert `print()` statements into your code to display the values of variables or messages about the execution flow.\n",

    "## 3. Introduction to `pdb` (Python Debugger) Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "`pdb` is Python's built-in interactive debugger. It allows you to pause your program at any point, inspect variable values, execute code line by line, and change the program's flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. How to use `pdb`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can activate `pdb` by adding the following line to your code at the point where you want to start debugging:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pdb; pdb.set_trace()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the program reaches this line, it will pause, and you will see a `(Pdb)` prompt in your terminal or Jupyter console.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Basic `pdb` commands\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n` (next): Execute the current line of code and move to the next line within the same function.\n",
    "* `s` (step): Execute the current line of code. If that line calls a function, `step` will go inside that function.\n",
    "* `c` (continue): Continue program execution until the next breakpoint is hit or the program finishes.\n",
    "* `p <variable_name>` (print): Print the value of a variable.\n",
    "* `l` (list): Display the source code around the current position.\n",
    "* `q` (quit): Exit the debugger and stop the program.\n",
    "* `h` (help): Display help about `pdb` commands.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Breakpoints:** Set points in your code where you want the program to pause.\n",
    "* **Step-through execution:**\n",
    "    * **Step Over:** Execute the current line of code and move to the next. If the current line calls a function, it executes the entire function without stepping inside.\n",
    "    * **Step Into:** Execute the current line of code. If that line calls a function, it steps inside that function.\n",
    "    * **Step Out:** Exit the current function and continue execution at the point where that function was called.\n",
    "* **Variable Inspection:** View and even change the values of variables when the program is paused.\n",
    "* **Call Stack:** See the sequence of function calls that led to the current position.\n",
    "* **Watch Expressions:** Monitor the values of specific expressions as the program runs.\n",
    "* **Interactive Console:** Execute Python commands in the context of the program being debugged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. How to use Debugger in VS Code (Overview):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Install Python Extension:** Make sure you have the Python extension installed for VS Code.\n",
    "2.  **Open Python file:** Open your `.py` file or Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`).\n",
    "3.  **Set a Breakpoint:** Click on the left margin of the code line where you want the program to pause. A red dot will appear.\n",
    "4.  **Start Debugging:**\n",
    "    * Press `F5` or go to the **\"Run\" > \"Start Debugging\"** menu.\n",
    "    * VS Code will launch the program and pause at the first breakpoint.\n",
    "5.  **Use Debugger Controls:** A small toolbar will appear with control buttons (Step Over, Step Into, Step Out, Continue, Stop).\n",
    "6.  **Inspect Variables:** In the \"Run and Debug\" sidebar, you can view local and global variables and set watch expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. How to use Debugger in PyCharm (Overview):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Open Project:** Open your project folder in PyCharm.\n",
    "2.  **Set a Breakpoint:** Click on the left margin of the code line. A red dot will appear.\n",
    "3.  **Start Debugging:**\n",
    "    * Click the \"Debug\" button (bug icon) on the toolbar.\n",
    "    * PyCharm will run the program and pause at the breakpoint.\n",
    "4.  **Use Debugger Controls:** Control buttons (Step Over, Step Into, Step Out, Resume Program, Stop) will be displayed.\n",
    "5.  **Inspect Variables:** The \"Variables\" window will show the values of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:** Very powerful, intuitive, provides a comprehensive view of the program's state.\n",
    "**Cons:** Requires IDE installation and configuration, may have an initial learning curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practice Exercises:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Debugging with `print()`:**\n",
    "    * Write a function `calculate_product(a, b, c)` that returns the product of three numbers.\n",
    "    * Intentionally introduce a logical error by writing `return a + b * c` instead of `a * b * c`.\n",
    "    * Use `print()` statements to print the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and the intermediate result before `return`.\n",
    "    * Find and fix the bug.\n",
    "2.  **Using `pdb`:**\n",
    "    * Write a function `find_item(item_list, target)` that searches for `target` in `item_list`.\n",
    "    * If `target` is found, return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.\n",
    "    * Add `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` at the beginning of the function.\n",
    "    * Call the function with a list and a target that exists, then call it with a target that does not exist.\n",
    "    * Use `n`, `p`, `c` commands to trace execution and inspect variable values.\n",
    "3.  **Debugging in IDE (Optional):**\n",
    "    * Open a Python file in VS Code or PyCharm.\n",
    "    * Create a simple function that causes an `IndexError` or `KeyError`.\n",
    "    * Set a breakpoint at the line that causes the error.\n",
    "    * Run the program in debug mode.\n",
    "    * Use the \"Step Into\", \"Step Over\", \"Variable Inspection\" features to understand how the error occurs."
