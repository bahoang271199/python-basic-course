    "# Lesson 6.1: Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "In software development, errors are inevitable. Python provides a robust mechanism to handle these errors gracefully, known as **exception handling**. This lesson will help you understand different types of errors, how to catch and handle them, and how to define your own custom exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Concept of Errors and Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are two main types of problems that can occur in a program:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Syntax Errors:** These are errors that occur when you write code that does not conform to Python's grammatical rules. The Python interpreter detects these errors before the program executes and prevents the program from running.\n",
    "    **Examples:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # print(\"Hello\" # Missing closing parenthesis\n",
    "    # if x > 5     # Missing colon\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    You will see a `SyntaxError` when running code with syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exceptions:** These are errors that occur during program execution (runtime errors), even if the code's syntax is correct. An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program. If not handled, an exception will cause the program to stop and display an error message (traceback).\n",
    "    **Examples:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Division by zero\n",
    "    # result = 10 / 0 # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Accessing a non-existent index\n",
    "    # my_list = [1, 2]\n",
    "    # print(my_list[2]) # This will raise an IndexError\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Invalid type conversion\n",
    "    # num = int(\"abc\") # This will raise a ValueError\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    The goal of exception handling is to \"catch\" these errors and perform alternative actions instead of letting the program crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Common Exception Types in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a hierarchy of built-in exceptions. Some common types you will frequently encounter:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ZeroDivisionError`: Occurs when dividing a number by zero.\n",
    "* `TypeError`: Occurs when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type (e.g., adding a number to a string).\n",
    "* `NameError`: Occurs when a variable or name is not defined.\n",
    "* `IndexError`: Occurs when you try to access an index that is out of range for a sequence (list, tuple, string).\n",
    "* `KeyError`: Occurs when you try to access a non-existent key in a dictionary.\n",
    "* `ValueError`: Occurs when a function receives an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value (e.g., `int(\"abc\")`).\n",
    "* `FileNotFoundError`: Occurs when you try to open a file that does not exist.\n",
    "* `IOError`: Occurs when there's a general input/output error.\n",
    "* `AttributeError`: Occurs when you try to access a non-existent attribute or method on an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. The `try-except` Block: Catching and Handling Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic structure for handling exceptions is the `try-except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "except ExceptionType:\n",
    "    # This code block will be executed if ExceptionType occurs in the try block\n",
    "```\n",

    "In the example above, if the user enters 0 for the second number, a `ZeroDivisionError` will be caught and the message \"Error: Cannot divide by zero!\" will be printed. If the user enters text instead of a number, a `ValueError` will be caught.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a general `except` to catch any type of exception if you don't want to specify it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that might cause an error\n",
    "    data = [1, 2]\n",

    "    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "    print(f\"Error type: {type(e)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Note:** Using `except Exception as e` too broadly can hide errors that you should handle more specifically. Try to catch the most specific exceptions possible.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 4. `except` Block with Multiple Exception Types\n",
    "\n",

    "    * Use `try-except` to catch `ZeroDivisionError` if the second number is 0 and `ValueError` if the input is not a number. Print appropriate error messages.\n",
    "2.  **`except` with Multiple Exception Types:**\n",
    "    * Given a dictionary `grades = {\"Alice\": 90, \"Bob\": 85}`.\n",
    "    * Ask the user to enter a student's name.\n",
    "    * Attempt to print that student's grade.\n",
    "    * Use a single `except` block to catch both `KeyError` (if the name doesn't exist) and `ValueError` (if there's a type conversion error). Print a general error message for these cases.\n",
    "3.  **`else` and `finally`:**\n",
    "    * Write a function `process_file(filename)` that takes a filename.\n",
    "    * In the `try` block, open the file, read its content, and print it.\n",
    "    * In the `except FileNotFoundError`, print a message indicating the file was not found.\n",
    "    * In the `else` block, print \"File processed successfully.\"\n",
    "    * In the `finally` block, print \"File operation has ended.\"\n",
    "    * Call the function with an existing file (you might need to create a dummy `test.txt` first) and a non-existent file.\n",
    "4.  **Custom Exception:**\n",
    "    * Define a custom exception `NegativeNumberError` that inherits from `Exception`.\n",
    "    * Write a function `calculate_square_root(num)`:\n",
    "        * If `num` is a negative number, `raise NegativeNumberError` with an appropriate message.\n",
    "        * Otherwise, return the square root of the number.\n",
    "    * Use `try-except` to call this function with a positive number and a negative number, catching `NegativeNumberError` and printing the message."
