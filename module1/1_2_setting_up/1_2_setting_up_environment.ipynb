    "# Lesson 1.2: Setting Up Your Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will delve into the essential steps for setting up your Python development environment on your computer. Having a proper working environment is crucial for you to effectively start writing and running Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Installing Python on Various Operating Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a cross-platform language, meaning you can install and run it on different operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Installation on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Download the installer:** Visit the official Python website: [python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).\n",
    "2.  **Choose a version:** Download the latest stable Python version (e.g., Python 3.x.x). Make sure to select the installer appropriate for your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).\n",
    "3.  **Run the installer:**\n",
    "    * Open the downloaded `.exe` file.\n",
    "    * **VERY IMPORTANT:** Check the box **\"Add Python X.Y to PATH\"** (where X.Y is your Python version) at the bottom of the first installation window. This will make it easier to run Python from Command Prompt or PowerShell.\n",
    "    * Select **\"Install Now\"** to install with default options or \"Customize installation\" if you wish to customize.\n",
    "4.  **Verify installation:** Open Command Prompt (CMD) or PowerShell and type:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python --version\n",
    "    # or\n",
    "    py --version\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    If Python is installed successfully, you will see the version number displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Installation on macOS\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Python is pre-installed:** macOS usually comes with a version of Python (often an older Python 2.x). However, you should install the latest Python 3.x version for modern development.\n",
    "2.  **Use Homebrew (recommended):** Homebrew is a popular package manager for macOS.\n",
    "    * Open Terminal.\n",
    "    * Install Homebrew (if not already installed) using the following command:\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh))\"\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    * Install Python 3:\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        brew install python\n",

    "    You should see the Python 3 version number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Installation on Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Python is pre-installed:** Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. However, you should also ensure you have the latest Python 3 version.\n",
    "2.  **Update system:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    sudo apt update\n",
    "    sudo apt upgrade\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3.  **Install Python 3:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",

    "## 3. Introduction to and Installation of `virtualenv` (or `venv`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need Virtual Environments?**\n",
    "\n",
    "During Python development, you might work on various projects, and each project might require different versions of libraries. If you install all libraries into the system's global Python environment, this can lead to version conflicts and dependency issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environments solve this problem by creating an isolated Python environment for each project. Each virtual environment has its own installation directory, its own set of libraries, and does not affect other projects or the system's global Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to create and activate `venv` (built-in in Python 3.3+):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Navigate to your project directory:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    cd your_project_folder\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2.  **Create a virtual environment:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python -m venv venv # 'venv' is the name of the virtual environment folder, you can choose another name\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This command will create a `venv` folder (or your chosen name) inside your project directory.\n",
    "3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**\n",
    "    * **On Windows (Command Prompt):**\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    * **On Windows (PowerShell):**\n",
    "        ```powershell\n",
    "        .\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    * **On macOS/Linux:**\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    When the virtual environment is activated, you will see `(venv)` or your virtual environment's name appear at the beginning of your command prompt.\n",
    "4.  **Deactivate the virtual environment:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    deactivate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
