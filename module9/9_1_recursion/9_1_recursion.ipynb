    "# Lesson 9.1: Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, **Recursion** is a powerful and elegant technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. Recursion is often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, self-similar versions of themselves.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Concept of Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself, either directly or indirectly. Imagine a set of nested Russian dolls: to open the largest doll, you must open the doll inside it, and so on until you find the smallest doll that contains nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, this means a function will call another version of itself with a smaller or simpler input, until a **base case** is reached that can be solved directly.\n",

    "## 2. Recursive Functions and Base Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Every recursive function must have two main parts to work correctly:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Base Case:** This is the condition under which the function no longer calls itself, and returns a value directly. The base case is crucial to prevent infinite recursion and Stack Overflow Errors.\n",
    "2.  **Recursive Step:** This is the part where the function calls itself with a modified input (usually smaller or closer to the base case).\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def recursive_function(parameters):\n",
    "    if base_case_condition:\n",
    "        return base_case_value # Base case\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # Modify parameters to move closer to the base_case\n",
    "        # Call the recursive function with new parameters\n",

    "    if n == 0: # Base case: Factorial of 0 is 1\n",

    "## 4. Pros and Cons of Recursion and When to Use It\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clean and Elegant Code:** For problems with a natural recursive structure (like tree traversals, graph algorithms, factorial, Fibonacci), a recursive solution is often more concise and easier to understand than an iterative one.\n",
    "* **Easier Logic Comprehension:** When a problem is defined recursively, translating that definition into recursive code is often very direct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Performance:**\n",
    "    * **Memory Intensive:** Each recursive function call creates a new stack frame on the call stack to store local variables and return addresses. With a large number of recursive calls, this can lead to excessive memory usage.\n",
    "    * **Slower:** The overhead of function calls and stack frame management often makes recursive solutions slightly slower than equivalent iterative solutions.\n",
    "* **Risk of Stack Overflow:** If the base case is not correctly defined or never reached, the function will continue to call itself until the call stack memory is exhausted, leading to a `RecursionError`. Python has a default recursion limit (usually 1000 calls).\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. When to Use Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "* **When the problem's structure is naturally recursive:** Classic examples include algorithms on tree-like data structures (binary tree traversal), graphs, or divide-and-conquer problems.\n",
    "* **When the recursive solution is clearer and easier to understand:** Sometimes, writing an iterative solution for a recursive problem can be significantly more complex and less readable.\n",
    "* **When performance is not a critical factor:** For problems where the number of recursive calls is not excessively large or performance is not the primary concern, recursion can be a good choice.\n",
    "* **Avoid for problems that can be solved more efficiently iteratively:** For problems like factorial or Fibonacci (especially Fibonacci), an iterative solution (or memoized recursion, which will be covered later) is often more performant.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practice Exercises:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sum of Numbers from 1 to N:**\n",
    "    * Write a recursive function `sum_up_to_n(n)` to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to `n`.\n",
    "    * Example: `sum_up_to_n(3)` should return `3 + 2 + 1 = 6`.\n",
    "    * Ensure there's a clear base case and recursive step.\n",
    "2.  **Calculate Power:**\n",
    "    * Write a recursive function `power(base, exp)` to calculate `base` raised to the power of `exp` (e.g., `2^3 = 8`).\n",
    "    * Assume `exp` is a non-negative integer.\n",
    "    * Example: `power(2, 3)` should return `8`.\n",
    "3.  **Reverse a String:**\n",
    "    * Write a recursive function `reverse_string(s)` to reverse a string.\n",
    "    * Example: `reverse_string(\"hello\")` should return `\"olleh\"`.\n",
    "    * Hint: An empty string is the base case. For a non-empty string, you can take the last character and concatenate it with the reversed rest of the string.\n",
    "4.  **Check Palindrome:**\n",
    "    * Write a recursive function `is_palindrome(s)` to check if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward). Ignore case and spaces.\n",
    "    * Example: `is_palindrome(\"madam\")` -> `True`, `is_palindrome(\"A man a plan a canal Panama\")` -> `True`.\n",
    "    * Hint: Process the string to only contain lowercase letters. The base case is an empty string or a single character string."
