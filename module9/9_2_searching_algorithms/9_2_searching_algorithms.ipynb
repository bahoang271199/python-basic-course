    "# Lesson 9.2: Introduction to Search Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, **search algorithms** are among the most fundamental and important types of algorithms. They are used to find a specific element within a collection of data. This lesson will introduce two common search algorithms: Linear Search and Binary Search, along with a basic understanding of time complexity.\n",

    "## 1. Linear Search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear search** (also known as sequential search) is the simplest search algorithm. It works by checking each element in the list sequentially until the desired element is found or the entire list has been traversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **How it works:**\n",
    "    1.  Start from the first element of the list.\n",
    "    2.  Compare the current element with the target value.\n",
    "    3.  If they match, return the index of that element.\n",
    "    4.  If they don't match, move to the next element.\n",
    "    5.  If the entire list is traversed without finding the element, return a special value (e.g., -1) to indicate that it was not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Requirement:** Does not require the list to be sorted.\n",

    "## 3. Time Complexity (Big O notation) - Basic Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity** is a way to describe the performance of an algorithm as the input size grows. It indicates the growth rate of the algorithm's execution time with respect to the input size. We use **Big O notation** to express time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big O does not measure exact execution time (as it depends on hardware, programming language, etc.) but rather the number of basic operations the algorithm performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Common Big O Notations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **O(1) - Constant Time:**\n",
    "    * Execution time does not change with input size.\n",
    "    * **Example:** Accessing an element in a list by index, adding/removing an element at the end of a list (Python Lists).\n",
    "    * **Best.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **O(log n) - Logarithmic Time:**\n",
    "    * Execution time increases very slowly as input size grows. Often seen in algorithms that halve the problem size.\n",
    "    * **Example:** Binary search.\n",
    "    * **Very Good.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **O(n) - Linear Time:**\n",
    "    * Execution time increases proportionally with input size.\n",
    "    * **Example:** Linear search, iterating through all elements in a list.\n",
    "    * **Acceptable.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time:**\n",
    "    * Common in efficient sorting algorithms.\n",
    "    * **Example:** Merge Sort, Quick Sort.\n",
    "    * **Quite Good.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **O(nÂ²) - Quadratic Time:**\n",
    "    * Execution time increases with the square of the input size. Often occurs with nested loops.\n",
    "    * **Example:** Bubble Sort, Selection Sort.\n",
    "    * **Worse.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **O(2^n) - Exponential Time:**\n",
    "    * Execution time grows exponentially with input size. Very slow for large inputs.\n",
    "    * **Example:** Some unoptimized recursive algorithms (e.g., naive recursive Fibonacci).\n",
    "    * **Very Bad.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Big O of Linear Search and Binary Search:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Linear Search:**\n",
    "    * **Best Case:** O(1) - The target element is the first element.\n",
    "    * **Worst/Average Case:** O(n) - The target element is the last element or not present, or somewhere in the middle of the list.\n",
    "    * **Conclusion:** The time complexity of linear search is **O(n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Binary Search:**\n",
    "    * **Best Case:** O(1) - The target element is the middle element.\n",
    "    * **Worst/Average Case:** O(log n) - Each iteration, the search space is halved.\n",
    "    * **Conclusion:** The time complexity of binary search is **O(log n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison:** For a list of 1 million elements:\n",
    "* Linear Search might need up to 1 million comparisons.\n",
    "* Binary Search would only need approximately $\\log_2(1,000,000) \\approx 20$ comparisons.\n",
    "This illustrates the significant difference in performance when dealing with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practice Exercises:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Linear Search:**\n",
    "    * Create a list `numbers = [15, 8, 23, 4, 42, 16]`.\n",
    "    * Use the defined `linear_search` function to search for the number `42` and the number `10`. Print the results.\n",
    "2.  **Binary Search:**\n",
    "    * Create a sorted list `sorted_numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]`.\n",
    "    * Use the defined `binary_search` function to search for the number `25` and the number `12`. Print the results.\n",
    "3.  **Performance Comparison (Empirical):**\n",
    "    * Create a large list (e.g., 100,000 sorted random numbers).\n",
    "    * Measure the execution time of `linear_search` and `binary_search` to find an element (e.g., the last element or a random element).\n",
    "    * Use the `time` module to measure time (e.g., `start_time = time.time(); ...; end_time = time.time(); print(end_time - start_time)`).\n",
    "    * Observe the difference in time."
